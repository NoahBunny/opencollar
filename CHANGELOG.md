starting with v1.0.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md §Known weaknesses` — documented BunnyTasker display-keys-only mesh apply, cleartext-for-LAN posture.
- Bunny Tasker now has an explicit `res/xml/network_security_config.xml` declaring the same cleartext-for-LAN intent as The Collar (was relying on the platform default).
- **P2 paywall hardening (2026-04-17)** — last state-ownership migration. Server is now the single writer for enforcement-driven `paywall` increments; phones are pure event reporters. New `shared/focuslock_penalties.py` with escape-tier formula + compound-interest rate table. New server actions `app-launch-penalty` (`+$50` with 10s endpoint dedup), `good-behavior-tick` (`-$5` in tribute/fine loop), `compound-interest-tick` + `check_compound_interest()` 60s thread, `tamper_attempt` event type on `/escape-event`. `escape-recorded` now applies tiered `$5×tier` (1-3 → $5, 4-6 → $10, …). `tamper-recorded` applies `$500` on attempt/detected and `$1000` on removed (was only removed). `geofence-breach-recorded` applies `+$100` + seeds `paywall_original` for compound base. Collar (slave v69) + companion (v49) deleted local `focus_lock_paywall` writes for these events. 23 new tests in `tests/test_paywall_hardening.py`. See commit `a9dec67`.
- **P2 paywall hardening — deferred follow-ups (2026-04-17)** — closes the five items the original P2 commit deferred. Server is now the single writer for the remaining bunny-initiated and SMS-driven paywall paths.
  - **SMS sit-boy** is now a `sit_boy` event type on `/api/mesh/{id}/escape-event`. The Collar's `SmsReceiver` keeps the lock-state writes (UX immediacy) but delegates the dollar amount to the server — clamped to `SIT_BOY_MAX_AMOUNT = $500` so a hijacked controller SIM can't drain. New action `sit-boy-recorded` + 4 tests.
  - **Bunny-initiated unsubscribe** moved to a new `POST /api/mesh/{id}/unsubscribe` (bunny-signed, mirrors `/subscribe`). Fee table standardised to `UNSUBSCRIBE_FEES = {bronze: 50, silver: 70, gold: 100}` (2× one period of the actual subscribe-charge amount — fixes a pre-existing inconsistency where the Collar's hardcoded $20/$50/$100 disagreed with what the Bunny Tasker dialog showed). Bunny Tasker's `doUnsubscribe()` now POSTs the signed request via the new `postUnsubscribeToMesh()` helper. The Collar's local `doUnsubscribe()` is `@Deprecated` and refuses with a 4xx pointing the caller at the server endpoint — no local paywall write remains. New action `unsubscribe-charge` + 5 tests.
  - **Bunny-initiated gamble** moved to a new `POST /api/mesh/{id}/gamble` (bunny-signed). Server runs `secrets.SystemRandom().choice([True, False])` and applies via the new `gamble-resolved` action; closes the "tampered Collar always rolls heads" loophole. The Collar's `doGamble()` is now a thin signing-proxy preserving the existing local-HTTP response contract for the web UI / Lion's Share callers. 4 tests.
  - **Release-Forever** now zeros `paywall` + `paywall_original` in the orders doc when `release-device` fires with `target=all`. Without this the orders doc kept the pre-teardown balance forever (no Collar remained to bump it down). Per-device targets unaffected. 2 tests.
  - **Local `PaymentListener.java` removed** (~226 lines). The server's IMAP scanner has been the authoritative payment-detection path since 2026-04-15; the local NotificationListenerService duplicated it, wrote unsigned amounts, and forced the Collar to hold a broad notification-access permission across every bank app on the phone. `AndroidManifest.xml` service entry, `BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE` permission, and the `re-enslave-phones.sh` `cmd notification allow_listener` grant + verification step all gone. `docs/STATE-OWNERSHIP.md` payment row updated.
  - Slave bumped to v70 (8.27); companion to v50 (2.17). Total tests: 38 (was 23).

### Changed
- Android versions bumped for landmine fixes: The Collar v61 (was v60), Bunny Tasker v44 (was v43), Lion's Share v64 (was v63).
- Android versions bumped for P2 paywall hardening follow-ups: The Collar v70 (was v69), Bunny Tasker v50 (was v49).
- Bunny Tasker bumped to v51 (2.18) for the audit C4 signature-verification fix.
- Lion's Share manifest dropped the deprecated `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` attribute — the `networkSecurityConfig` file is authoritative and already permits cleartext. Added inline comment in the config explaining the LAN-gossip rationale and the HTTPS-relay discipline requirement.

### Fixed
- **The Collar (slave) TOCTOU race on meshVersion**: gossip-RX handler at `ControlService.java:2446` now wraps the `check-apply-set` on `meshVersion` in `synchronized (meshVersion) { ... }`, matching the pattern already used by the gossip-TX response handler at ~line 3676. Closes landmine #18 (was CRITICAL-for-correctness, LOW-practical).
- **Desktop heartbeat registry file-write race (roadmap #5)** — `/run/focuslock/desktop-heartbeats.json` was mutated from two threads (HTTP heartbeat handler + hourly `check_desktop_heartbeats` penalty thread) with no synchronization, so a heartbeat landing mid-penalty-tick could get clobbered back to stale state. Lifted the registry into a new thread-safe `DesktopRegistry` class in `focuslock_mesh.py` that mirrors the `MessageStore` shape (internal `threading.Lock`, atomic temp+`os.replace` save). `focuslock-mail.py` instantiates the singleton and both call sites now go through `heartbeat()` / `snapshot()` / `mark_warned()` / `mark_penalized()` / `summary_line()`. Schema and HTTP surface unchanged; no migration or version bump. 6 new tests in `TestDesktopRegistry` including a 25-thread concurrent-heartbeat regression.

### Security
- **Audit C4 — Bunny Tasker verifies lion signature before mandatory-reply auto-lock (2026-04-18).** `refreshMeshMessages` at `android/companion/.../MainActivity.java:1929` was reading `from:"lion"` and `mandatory_reply:true` straight from the fetched message JSON and auto-locking the phone (`focus_lock_active=1`) if the message was overdue, without any crypto check on the sender. A compromised relay — or any path that bypasses the signed `/messages/send` endpoint — could inject `from:"lion", mandatory_reply:true, ts:old` and force-lock the bunny. Fixed at both ends:
  - **Server:** `/api/mesh/{id}/messages/send` now stores the lion signature + client `ts` + `node_id` alongside each message entry in `MessageStore`, so recipients can reconstruct the signed payload (`mesh|node|from|text|pinned|mandatory|ts`) on fetch. The server already verified the signature on receive — this commit just preserves the evidence through to the reader.
  - **Bunny Tasker (v51):** new `verifyLionMessageSignature(JSONObject, meshId)` helper reconstructs the signed payload from the fetched message and checks it against the locally-stored `focus_lock_lion_pubkey` via `PairingManager.verify`. The auto-lock path only fires if the signature verifies; unsigned + invalid are treated identically (log + skip). Pre-fix messages in existing stores have no signature and will not auto-lock — acceptable because the threshold is 4h and lion can always re-send.
  - No controller change needed — Lion's Share (v64+) already signs over the pinned+mandatory flags. Slave unchanged.
  - 2 new tests in `TestMessageStore` pin the signature + client-ts round-trip through the store.
- **Audit-driven server hardening (2026-04-17).** Full-codebase audit surfaced six exploitable issues in the server + installer. This commit closes the ones that don't require an APK rebuild; the Android-side items (slave HTTP signature verification, Bunny Tasker mandatory-reply signature check, QR pairing fingerprint pin) are deferred to a follow-up commit.
  - **Unauthenticated enforcement webhooks (C2).** `/webhook/entrap` and `/webhook/desktop-penalty` now require `admin_token`. `/webhook/entrap` directly calls `enforce_jail()` (ADB-disables launcher, settings, user-switcher); `/webhook/desktop-penalty` does a read-modify-write on the paywall via ADB. Both were reachable with no auth. The Linux desktop collar (`focuslock-desktop.py`) now reads `admin_token` from `~/.config/focuslock/config.json` (or `FOCUSLOCK_ADMIN_TOKEN` env) and sends it in the penalty payload. `/webhook/desktop-penalty` also clamps caller-supplied `amount` to 0..$500 as defense-in-depth. The register / heartbeat / controller-register / bunny-message webhooks remain unauth'd for now — they're called from the slave APK which doesn't hold `admin_token`, and need a signed-event rewire that will ship with the slave follow-up commit.
  - **Disposal-token double-spend race (C3).** `/admin/order` consumed single-use disposal tokens with an unlocked check-then-set on the `_disposal_tokens` dict, so two concurrent redemptions could both pass the `used==False` check and double-apply. Added module-level `_disposal_tokens_lock`; the issue + cleanup path at `/admin/disposal-token` and the atomic check-validate-claim path at `/admin/order` now both hold the lock.
  - **Sudoers privilege escalation via wildcard source paths (C6).** `installers/install-desktop-collar.sh` was writing `/etc/sudoers.d/focuslock` with rules like `NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cp * /opt/focuslock/*` and `chmod * /opt/focuslock/*`. Sudoers wildcards match `/`, so `sudo cp /etc/shadow /opt/focuslock/x` and `sudo chmod 4755 /opt/focuslock/user-written.sh` both matched — enabling arbitrary-file exfiltration to root-readable and local-root via setuid. Replaced with `install -D -m 0{644,0755}` rules scoped to filename patterns starting with `focuslock`, `lion_pubkey.pem`, `collar-icon*`, `crown-*`, or `web/index.html`; mode is restricted to non-setuid/setgid/sticky values. `systemctl restart` rules replaced wildcard patterns (`*focuslock*`, `*claude*`) with explicit service names. `installers/re-enslave-desktops.sh` updated to use `sudo install -D -m 0644` where it previously used `sudo cp`; the redundant `sudo chmod 755` on the deployed scripts was removed (`install -m` already sets the mode).

### Changed
- **Mesh persistence lock hygiene (audit H1, H2).** `OrdersDocument.get()` now acquires `self.lock` — a concurrent `apply_remote()` could previously return a torn read on a mid-update key. Added `OrdersDocument.snapshot()` returning a shallow copy safe to read outside the lock. Added `PeerRegistry.snapshot()` returning `{node_id: PeerInfo}` safe to iterate; `handle_mesh_status` switched to it (was iterating `peers.peers.items()` directly, which could raise `RuntimeError` if another thread called `update_peer` mid-iteration). `VoucherPool.redeem` (audit H5) was already correctly locked — the audit flagged it as a false positive, no change needed. `check_compound_interest`'s `list(_orders_registry.docs.items())` snapshot (audit H7) is also the correct pattern — no change needed.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-14

First public release. Everything below landed in the run-up to v1.0 across Phases 0 → 7.5 (see `docs/PUBLISHABLE-ROADMAP.md` and the commit log for sequencing).

### Added
- `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability disclosure policy
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — custom code of conduct tailored to the power-exchange context
- `.editorconfig` — shared editor conventions
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file
- `docs/PUBLISHABLE-ROADMAP.md` — phased plan to v1.0.0
- `pyproject.toml` — ruff + mypy configuration (Phase 1a)
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — ruff, ruff-format, mypy on shared/, hygiene hooks (Phase 1a)
- `.git-blame-ignore-revs` — skip mechanical reformat commits in `git blame` (Phase 1a)
- `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` module pattern in `shared/focuslock_vault.py`, `shared/focuslock_payment.py`, `focuslock_mesh.py`, `focuslock-mail.py` (Phase 1b-core)
- `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` extended to the remaining 11 modules: `focuslock-desktop{,-win}.py`, `focuslock_ntfy.py`, `installers/re-enslave-watcher.py`, and the shared/ helpers (`focuslock_adb`, `focuslock_config`, `focuslock_evidence`, `focuslock_http`, `focuslock_llm`, `focuslock_sync`, `focuslock_transport`) (Phase 1b-tail)
- `logging.basicConfig` wired at startup in the three entry-points (`focuslock-mail.py`, `focuslock-desktop.py`, `focuslock-desktop-win.py`) — format `%(asctime)s %(levelname)-7s %(name)s: %(message)s`, datefmt `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`. Library modules inherit from the root logger (Phase 1b-tail)
- **Phase 2 — unit test suite.** `tests/` with 266 tests covering the shared/ security-critical surface. Coverage: `focuslock_vault.py` 100%, `focuslock_payment.py` 92%, `focuslock_mesh.py` 70%, `focuslock_config.py` 98%, `focuslock_http.py` 100%, `focuslock_adb.py` 96% — 78% combined (≥75% exit criterion met). `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` + `[tool.coverage.*]` added to `pyproject.toml`. Invoke with `uv run --with pytest --with pytest-cov --with cryptography pytest tests/`. Also documents a within-call dedup quirk in `VoucherPool.store` (cross-call dedup, which is what matters in production, works correctly).
- **Phase 3 — QA infrastructure.** `docs/QA-CHECKLIST.md` (14-section regression matrix), `docs/STAGING.md` (isolated staging mesh setup with Waydroid), `docs/MANUAL-QA.md` (on-device checklist for radios Waydroid can't emulate). `staging/config.json.template` + `staging/start-staging.sh` for a scriptable staging relay bound to 127.0.0.1. `staging/qa_runner.py` — scripted Lion that drives the admin API through lock/unlock/paywall/subscribe/message flows and verifies state transitions. On first run, surfaced two real bugs in `focuslock-mail.py` (see Fixed).
- **Lion's Share controller v63** — new **Payment Email** button on the main screen (`android/controller/res/layout/activity_main.xml`) opens a dialog for IMAP host / email / app-password, saves to prefs, and POSTs `/api/set-payment-email`. Version bumped 62 → 63 (`AndroidManifest.xml`), `installers/re-enslave-lib.sh` retargeted to `focusctl-v63.apk`. Deployed to Jace's phone 2026-04-14 with data preserved (`-r` install, no re-pair).
- **Phase 4 — CI pipeline.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint + ruff format + mypy + pytest matrix on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12, build all 3 APKs, build Windows EXEs, verify APK signatures) and `.github/workflows/release.yml` (tag-driven release with auto-generated `SHA256SUMS.txt`, optional release-keystore secret, GitHub Release publication). `.github/dependabot.yml` for weekly pip + GitHub Actions updates. Concurrency cancellation on stale PRs. RUF005 added to `build-win.py` per-file-ignores; one stale `body` → `_body` cleanup in `staging/qa_runner.py`. Residual `ruff format` drift on 10 previously-unformatted files (`focuslock-mail.py`, desktop collars, `shared/focuslock_{payment,sync}.py`, all `tests/test_*.py`) applied to make Phase 4 CI green.
- **Phase 5 — Build reproducibility.** `--release` flag on all three Android `build.sh` scripts. Release builds require `FOCUSLOCK_KEYSTORE` + `FOCUSLOCK_KEYSTORE_PASS` env vars and fail loudly if unset; debug auto-keystore stays for contributor builds. `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` set from git commit timestamp in the release workflow before PyInstaller runs. `--release` and `--debug` are the only accepted flags; unknown args fail fast.
- **Phase 6 — Outsider documentation.** `docs/BUILD.md` (toolchain matrix, per-component build commands, release-keystore generation, reproducibility notes), `docs/CONFIG.md` (every config field with type/default/security implications + 3 example configs), `docs/SELF-HOSTING.md` (DNS → TLS → server → first pairing in 8 steps + ops + backup checklist), `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md` (in-scope vs out-of-scope adversaries, two trust tiers, known v1 weaknesses), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (sanitized component map, source layout table, sequence diagrams for lock/payment/pairing/subscription, onboarding checklist). README rewritten with a pinned consent disclaimer banner, "Who is this for?" section, and a documentation index linking every doc page.
- **Phase 7 — Dependency + supply-chain hygiene.** `pyproject.toml` now ships proper `[project]` metadata (PEP 621): name `focuslock`, version `0.9.0`, GPL-3.0-or-later, classifiers, dependency on `cryptography>=42`, and `[project.optional-dependencies]` groups `desktop-win` (pystray + pillow), `server` (reserved), `dev` (pytest + pytest-cov + ruff + mypy). Project installs as metadata-only (`py-modules = []`) until a future src/ migration. Wheel builds clean (`uv build --wheel`). New `sbom` job in `release.yml` generates `SBOM.cdx.json` (CycloneDX 1.5) from `requirements.txt` via `cyclonedx-bom`; SBOM is uploaded as a release artifact, hashed in `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and attached to the GitHub Release. Android build-tools already pinned at `35.0.0` in every `build.sh` (verified). `SECURITY.md` already had the response SLA from Phase 0 (no change needed). ARM64 cryptography wheel-from-source caveat documented in `docs/BUILD.md`. `.gitignore` covers `*.egg-info/` from local wheel builds.
- **Phase 7.5 — Supply-chain finishing.** All GitHub Actions in `ci.yml` and `release.yml` pinned by commit SHA (tags kept as `# v4` comments for dependabot readability); immutable against tag-replacement supply-chain attacks. New `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` — CodeQL SAST on push + PR + weekly cron, queries `security-extended,security-and-quality`. New `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml` — OpenSSF Scorecard on push + weekly cron + branch-protection-rule trigger, publishes SARIF to the Security tab. Sigstore build provenance (`actions/attest-build-provenance@v2`) added to `release.yml` covering every APK, EXE, SBOM, APK-CERTS, and SHA256SUMS artifact — verifiable with `gh attestation verify`. New `APK-CERTS.txt` generation step extracts each APK's signing-cert SHA-256 fingerprint via `apksigner verify --print-certs` and publishes alongside `SHA256SUMS.txt` so users can validate sideloads against an authoritative cert list (with explanatory section in `docs/BUILD.md`). `CONTRIBUTING.md` rewritten end-to-end — what we accept vs discuss vs decline, AI-assisted-contribution disclosure policy, local-test command recipe, Android no-Gradle expectations. New `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` + `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug,feature,config}.yml` — bug template gates on SECURITY.md acknowledgment, feature template gates on design discussion + scope checklist (no consent/safety weakening), config routes security reports to the Security advisory form and usage questions to Discussions.

### Changed
- `focuslock-mail.py` — default `Host` header fallback changed from operator's personal domain to `localhost`
- `android/companion/.../MainActivity.java` — server URL input hint changed from operator's personal domain to a generic example
- Python codebase reformatted with `ruff format` (Phase 1a — mechanical, skipped in `git blame` via `.git-blame-ignore-revs`)
- Security-critical exception handlers now use structured logging at appropriate severity (Phase 1b-core):
  - Vault signature-verify and decrypt failures → `logger.warning`
  - Payment email parse + IMAP loop errors → `logger.warning`/`logger.error`
  - Mesh signature verify + state I/O (orders, peers, vouchers) → `logger.warning`
  - Roadmap-called-out `[warn]` prints in `focuslock-mail.py` (paywall parse, ntfy push, pairing registry) → logger
- All remaining ~300 diagnostic `print(...)` calls across `focuslock-mail.py` (~90), `focuslock-desktop.py` (~75), `focuslock-desktop-win.py` (~91), `focuslock_mesh.py` (~14), `focuslock_ntfy.py`, `shared/focuslock_payment.py` (~9 missed in Phase 1b-core), and smaller modules migrated to `logger.{info,warning,exception,debug}` with `%-format` lazy formatting (Phase 1b-tail)
- Silent `except Exception: pass` blocks triaged (Phase 1b-tail) — ADB wrapper, mesh trust I/O, mesh account load, homelab URL parse, Lion pubkey load now leave a debug breadcrumb. Tailscale/DNS probes and liberation cleanup stay intentionally silent.

### Fixed
- **Real bugs surfaced by lint (Phase 1a):**
  - `focuslock-desktop-win.py` was missing `import subprocess` (5 crash sites: bedtime check + 4 process-management paths) and `import datetime` (1 bedtime check site)
  - `focuslock-mail.py:806` called bare `push_to_peers(...)` instead of `mesh.push_to_peers(...)` — fine-application mesh push was broken
- `set-payment-email` feature completed with missing `ORDER_KEYS` schema entries and `focuslock_payment.py` consumer (hot-swappable IMAP creds via Lion's Share app)
- **QA-surfaced bugs (Phase 3):**
  - `focuslock-mail.py:530` — `add-paywall` accepted negative amounts and allowed the paywall to go negative. Now clamps the result to `max(0, current + delta)` and catches non-integer amount values.
  - `focuslock-mail.py:598-612` — `subscribe` with no explicit `due` param set `sub_due` to `now` instead of the documented `now + 7d`; the `now + 7d` branch was unreachable. Rewrote so the default is `now + 7d`, explicit `"now"` is still honored, and explicit ms values pass through — consistent with `project_sub_due_cap.md` ("pre-pay forfeits remainder").

### Security
- Payment security: anti-self-pay + recipient verification (prior work)
- Production hardening: crash safety, security, observability (prior work)
